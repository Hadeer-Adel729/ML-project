🚀 Machine Learning Project: MNIST Digit Recognition


🔍 Project Overview:
The MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits, serves as the foundation for this machine learning project. With its applications in image classification and digit recognition, the project aims to explore the capabilities of the TensorFlow framework, Scikit-Learn library, and delve into the realm of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN).


📊 Dataset Description:
The dataset, available in CSV format Download Here, consists of training and test sets. Each row represents an image, with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255, denoting grayscale intensity. Key files include:

mnist_train.csv: Training set with labeled images.
mnist_test.csv: Test set for model evaluation.


🎯 Project Objectives:

TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn Proficiency: Gain expertise in using TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn.
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and K-NN Familiarization: Understand the fundamentals of ANNs and K-NN.
Hyperparameter Tuning Comprehension: Explore and comprehend the concept of hyperparameter tuning.


🛠 Approach:


(a) Data Exploration and Preparation:

Load the dataset and perform initial exploration.
Identify unique classes and features.
Check for missing values.
Normalize pixel values (0 to 255).
Resize images to 28x28 dimensions and visualize reshaped images.
Split the training data into training and validation sets.
(b) Experiments and Results:

Initial Experiment: Implement K-NN classification with optimal hyperparameters using grid search.
Subsequent Experiment: Construct and train two ANN architectures, varying hidden neurons, learning rate, and batch size.
Compare outcomes to identify the highest accuracy on the validation dataset.
Obtain the confusion matrix of the best model.
Save and reload the best model for testing on the mnist_test.csv data.
